I’ve finally built my own [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) server and started hosting a simple A/B test statistical significance calculator. The calculator is still work in progress. I’ll improve it as soon as I have more time and make it more robust.
 
You may access the calculator [here](https://app.gorkemmeral.com/shiny/A-B-test-significance-calculator/).
