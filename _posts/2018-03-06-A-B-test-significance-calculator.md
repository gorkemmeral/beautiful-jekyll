I’ve finally built my own [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) server and started hosting a simple A/B test statistical significance calculator. The calculator is still work in progress, it is currently based on the R code [here](https://github.com/Jverma/Significance-in-A-B-testing). I’ll improve it as soon as I have more time and make it more robust.
 
You may access the calculator **[here](https://app.gorkemmeral.com/shiny/A-B-test-significance-calculator/)**.
