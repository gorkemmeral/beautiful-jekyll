ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) is a statistical technique to predict future trends using time series data. Autoregressive models forecast future values based on historical data. ARIMA models are commonly used in finance as well as business decision making processes. 

A sample R code to forecast sales with [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) can be found [here](https://github.com/gorkemmeral/ARIMA-forecast).
